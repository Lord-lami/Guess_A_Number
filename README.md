# Guess_A_Number
# This a command line game
# You pass a range of numbers like so:
# python guess_a_number_between.py 1 5
# The program will handle the rest once you give it a sufficent range
# YOu can cheat by giving something like
# python guess_a_number_between.py 1 1
# Here one will surely be the answer
# If you guess correctly at the first try you get a unique complement
# The program exits once you guess correctly
